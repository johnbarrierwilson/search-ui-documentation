A **[React](https://reactjs.org)** library that allows you to quickly implement search experiences without re-inventing the wheel.

Use it with [**Elastic App Search**](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/app-search-service?ultron=searchui-repo&blade=readme&hulk=product) or
[**Elastic Site Search**](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/site-search-service?ultron=searchui-repo&blade=readme&hulk=product) to have a
search experience up and running in minutes.

### Features :+1:
